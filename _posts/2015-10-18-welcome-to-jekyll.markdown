This is my first blog article. Every blog, of course, needs a name that is very deep, and mysteriously ambiguous: coding - wait for it - thoughts.

## how ##

After trying out [middleman][] as a static site generator (and running into many problems), I am now using [Jekyll][] (with fewer problems).

If you would like to **use Jekyll on Windows 7**, keep in mind to

- install Python 2.x.x and
- add python dir it to `PATH`
- run `gem install rouge` to install a different highlighter and 
- configure your site to use it by adding `highlighter: rouge` to your site's `_config.yml`
