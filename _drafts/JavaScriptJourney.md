# Approach to teaching yourself a new technology #

1. Research and understand its context. You need a starting point to ask questions.
2. Collect all aspects about it that you want/need to understand, all questions that you want answered.
3. Try to group these aspects into categories. Starting to learn something new is always confusing. You will need a good data stucture to store all the information you will encounter; grouping the questions you have and giving those groups good names *means* inventing this good data structure that will also store your answers later.
4. Try to bring your groups of questions into some "need to understand this before I can understand that"-order. Basics before advanced concepts. Now, you have your learning path: the order in which you want to work on these questions.
5. Before we start learning, let's compile a list of learning resources. We want to separate the two phases of self-education - (1) researching, judging, and choosing your learning resources, and (2) studying the chosen resource(s) - from each other here, because (1) needs a broader, high-level perspective, and (2) needs a narrow, detail-level perspective. Mixing both phases is often ineffective and will make you nervous. Try to avoid selecting too few or too many resources.
6. Now, you can start walking down your learning path. For each step, for each learning item, first try to improve the questions. Can you be more specific? The more specific the questions, the clearer the answer can be. Consult your learning resources for the answer. Once you are satisfied with your level of understanding, answer your questions in your *own words*. Write it down (or to file), sketch a diagram, just find a way to transfer your thoughts into the physical world.
